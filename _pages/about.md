Overview
======
I am currently an ESRC-funded PhD student at University of Nottingham. I am deeply fascinated by the intricacies of language as a complex and dynamic system. My research interests revolve around exploring how our intricate minds navigate and respond to the various phenomena encountered in language processing and acquisition.

In my previous studies, I have focused on topics such as lexical inferencing and incidental vocabulary acquisition from a multilingual perspective. Drawing inspiration from cognitive linguistics literature, I have developed the belief that the traditional distinction between words and grammar may not hold true. Instead, I view all linguistic information stored and processed in our minds as equal entities, regardless of their size. They are essentially units or chunks of information that can be stored and retrieved from our long-term memories.

One subject closely related to my research interests is formulaic language, which encompasses units ranging from components of words to syntactically complete phrases. Formulaic language will be the primary focus of my future studies.
